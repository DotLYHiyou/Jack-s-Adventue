# Jack's Adventure
A game made for Github Merge 2024. There are three endings to find, including one for cheating!

# How to play!

3. Use the arrow keys to move, then click on the stickman.
4. Answer the prompt that pops up. If the game is being iframed on a third-party games website then "womp womp" because you won't be able to play properly.
5. Enjoy!
